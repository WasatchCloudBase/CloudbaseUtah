# Cloudbase Utah

iPhone app for Utah paragliding pilots.  Provides weather forecasts, site readings, and live web cam views of the sky.

# Background
XCSkies is the best forecasting tool for Utah paragliders, particularly for going XC.
However, XCSkies has several limitations that this app addresses:
  - Does not provide the "big picture" weather forecast
  - Does not provide actual wind readings
  - Does not provide live web cam views of the sky
  - Lots of clicks to see the wind and lift at different times and elevations for a location
    (this is available through plot views, but with fewer details)
This app provides a quick look at all of this for each site.  XCSkies is still recommended for more detailed flight planning (especially XC).
